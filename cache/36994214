They claimed that the synthesized LK-99 materials exhibit the\nMeissner levitation phenomenon of superconductors and have a superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) higher than 400 K. Here, for the first time, we\nsuccessfully verify and synthesize the LK-99 crystals which can be magnetically\nlevitated with larger levitated angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room\ntemperature. It is expected to realize the true potential of room temperature,\nnon-contact superconducting magnetic levitation in near future.","image":"https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png"}
